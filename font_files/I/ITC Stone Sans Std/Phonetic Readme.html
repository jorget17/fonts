These phonetic typefaces represent spoken sound for linguists and others who work with languages and dialects.</font></p>		<p><font face="Myriad Web">Phonetic typefaces support the International Phonetic Association (IPA), in conformity with the alphabet approved by the International Phonetic Association at its 1989 conference in Kiel, West Germany, with one exception: the fonts do not include the contour tones, which are difficult to represent in a typeface. The phonetic typefaces also contains glyphs supplementary to the IPA font -- glyphs that are no longer part of the official IPA standard, but are either in current use or of historical significance.</font></p>		<p><font face="Myriad Web">Glyphs are graphic shapes that include diacritic marks, or accents; tone marks, or symbols, that represent five different pitches; and ordinary alphabetic characters such as r or t.</font></p>		<p><font face="Myriad Web">With Adobe InDesign&reg;, glyphs can be viewed and selected using the Insert Glyphs palette. There are alternative ways to view and select the glyphs in these (and any) OpenType fonts, depending on the application and operating system you are using. Please refer to your application or operating system documentation for more information.</font></p>		<p></p>		<font face="Myriad Web">			<hr>		</font><font size="-2" face="Myriad Web">&copy; 2003 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
