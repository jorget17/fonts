    Adobe Font Folio 11 is a multi-platform type collection that contains more than 2,300 fonts from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type">Adobe Type Library</a> in OpenType&reg; format. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype">OpenType</a> is a true cross-platform font format developed by Adobe and Microsoft  that can contain an expanded character set for better linguistic  support and enhanced typographic functionality. With OpenType, one font  file contains all of a font&rsquo;s outline and metrics information, and the  same font file can be used on the Macintosh and Windows platforms.
  <p>OpenType  fonts from Adobe can be installed and used alongside PostScript&reg; Type 1  and TrueType fonts, and can be printed to most output devices and  embedded in PDF files. OpenType fonts are natively supported on Mac OS X, Windows Vista, Windows XP and Windows  2000. They are compatible with older operating  systems via ATM Light, a free system software component from Adobe.  Once OpenType fonts are installed, virtually all applications can work with them, though applications must incorporate specific support to access  added typographic glyphs present in some OpenType fonts.</p>
  <p>The keystone  of any type library, Adobe Font Folio 11 offers a wide  range of font styles to choose from, including workhorse text  typefaces, innovative display typefaces, handwriting and script  typefaces, bullets and ornamental fonts. Font designs in this  collection were created by world-renowned type foundries, such as  Adobe, Monotype Imaging, ITC, and Linotype, cutting-edge foundries and talented individual designers. The fonts in Adobe  Font Folio 11 were then expertly crafted by Adobe&rsquo;s type  development staff, and represent some of the highest quality fonts  available, both in terms of design aesthetics and technical  reliability. </p>
    <p>To fully  explore the contents of this CD-ROM, you will need a recent version of Adobe Reader&reg;, a free utility for viewing and printing Portable Document  Format (PDF) files, as several of the files  are supplied  as PDFs. If you do not already have Adobe Reader, the  installer can be downloaded by pointing your browser to: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html</a></p>

    <li type="disc">Mac OS  X </li>
    <li type="disc">RAM as required by operating system and applications</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Font Folio fonts may also be installed under Mac OS 8.6 through 9.2 with ATM Light 4.6, and under Classic mode in Mac OS X, if you install ATM Light 4.6.2. If using a Postscript printer on Mac OS 8 or 9, the latest AdobePS printer driver is recommended.</p>

    <h2>Additional Software Installation</h2>
	</a></div>
 
   <div id="description">
   
      <p>   After reviewing the  system requirements above, you may need to install the latest versions  of the Adobe Type Manager Light software and the AdobePS printer  driver, which are both available as free downloads from the adobe.com  website.
<p><strong>Adobe Type Manager&reg; (ATM&reg;) Light:</strong><br />
             Adobe Type Manager (ATM) Light is a system software component that  automatically scales PostScript Type  1 or OpenType CFF outline font data for the screen, and to print to    both PostScript and non PostScript printers. To download ATM Light, go  to: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html</a></p>
           <p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Adobe recommends that once you install ATM Light, you increase the  utility's character cache setting (the amount of memory allocated for  storing font information and drawing it to your computer screen) to at  least 1 MB in the Macintosh version and to at least 512K in Windows  98/ME (with newer versions of Windows, ATM does not have a character cache  setting). To increase this setting in the Macintosh version, select the  Preferences&hellip; command in the File menu. In the Windows version, select  the &quot;Settings&quot; tab in the ATM window.</p>
           <p>In  most cases, it is not advisable to install ATM Light over an existing  older version of ATM Deluxe. Instead, you should upgrade to the  corresponding ATM Deluxe version. The exception is that Mac users may  install ATM Light 4.6.2 over ATM Deluxe 4.6.1, to get the benefits of  the updated ATM driver.</p>
           <p><strong>AdobePS Printer Driver (Windows XP, Windows 2000 or earlier, or Mac OS 8 or 9):</strong><br />
             If you are using one of the above operating systems, and printing to a PostScript printer or creating PostScript  print files, the AdobePS printer driver replaces your standard Mac or  Windows printer driver and offers several improvements. Installation of  this driver requires a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file for  your printer, which allows the driver to control all of your printer's  features, such as optional paper trays, enhanced imaging modes, and  duplex (two-sided) printing. More instructions are included in the Read  Me file that comes with the AdobePS software. </p>
