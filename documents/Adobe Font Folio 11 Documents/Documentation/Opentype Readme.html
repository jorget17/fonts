OpenType fonts containing Type 1 outlines have an .otf file name suffix, while those with TrueType outlines may have a .otf, .ttf or .ttc file name suffix. OpenType fonts with Type 1 outlines use the &ldquo;Compact Font Format&rdquo; or CFF to store those outlines. In Windows 2000, XP, and Vista, one can double-click on an OpenType font to get a sample sheet that indicates what kind of outlines the font file has.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">In general, both &quot;flavors&quot; of OpenType are equally supported in Adobe applications and in the PostScript language. Because both flavors share the same structures for multi-lingual support and advanced OpenType layout features, it is usually easy for applications and operating systems to support both flavors equally well.

With ATM, you can use OpenType CFF fonts at any size, and you can also enable &quot;font smoothing,&quot; which further improves the appearance of your fonts on-screen. ATM Light also allows you to print your PostScript Type 1 or OpenType CFF fonts to both PostScript and non PostScript printers. To download ATM Light, go to: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html</a>. If using AdobePS 8.8 on Mac OS, you should also <b>update</b> your <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=15&platform=Macintosh">ATM&nbsp;Light to version 4.6.1a</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=14&platform=Macintosh">ATM&nbsp;Deluxe to version 4.6.2a</a>.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">On Windows 2000 and XP, and Mac OS&nbsp;X when using only native applications, ATM&nbsp;Light is not necessary for OpenType CFF support. ATM Light is incompatible with Windows Vista.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><b>NOTE</b>: Adobe recommends that once you install ATM Light, you increase the utility's character cache setting (the amount of memory allocated for storing font information and drawing it to your computer screen) to at least 1 MB in the Macintosh version and to at least 512K in Windows 98/ME (when installed, ATM&nbsp;does not have a character cache setting on newer versions of Windows). To increase this setting in the Macintosh version, select the Preferences command in the File menu. In the Windows version, select the &quot;Settings&quot; tab in the ATM window.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">In most cases, it is not advisable to install ATM Light over an existing older version of ATM Deluxe. Instead, you should upgrade to the corresponding ATM Deluxe version. The exception is that Mac users may install ATM Light 4.6.2 over ATM Deluxe 4.6.1, to get the benefits of the updated ATM driver.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><b>AdobePS Printer Driver:</b><br>				If you are printing to a PostScript printer or creating PostScript print files, the AdobePS printer driver replaces your standard Mac or Windows printer driver and offers several improvements. Installation of this driver requires a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file for your printer, which allows the driver to control all of your printer's features, such as optional paper trays, enhanced imaging modes, and duplex (two-sided) printing. More instructions are included in the Read Me file that comes with the AdobePS software. </font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">To download the latest Adobe printer driver for the Macintosh, go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvmac.htm">http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvmac.htm</a></font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">To download the latest Adobe printer driver for Windows, go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm">http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm</a></font></p>		<p><a href="#Anchor-Adobe-47296"><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">back to top</font></a></p>		<hr size="5">		<h3><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"><a name="Anchor-WindowsIssues"></a></font><font color="#333333" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Windows Issues</font></h3>		<h4><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Some fonts do not appear in application font menus (style linking):</i></font></h4>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Symptom:</i><br>				A family of fonts appears to be installed. Some of the installed fonts from the family, but not all, appear in the font menu. Specifically, some of the weights are missing, and all of the italic fonts. The problem typically occurs in some applications (e.g. Microsoft Word, Adobe PageMaker, QuarkXPress) but not others (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign).</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Explanation:</i><br>				The other &quot;missing&quot; fonts are accessible by using the bold and italic style buttons in each application. There are two ways to tell which fonts are linked to which.</font></p>		<ol>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Use the Adobe Web site. Go to http://www.adobe.com/type, and navigate to the font package that contains the fonts in question. Click on the specific font in the package to get to the Web page that shows the full character set for that font. Click the &quot;More Info&quot; tab. Towards the bottom of the column, the &quot;Windows/PC Menu Name&quot;&nbsp;is listed. This shows both how the font is listed in the menu of Windows applications, and which additional style buttons are needed to access the font.</font>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Navigate to where the &quot;missing&quot; fonts are installed on your computer, and double-click on each. The sample window that comes up has the name of the font in large letters at the top. Two lines below this is an entry that says &quot;Typeface name&quot;; this is the name that shows in the font menu.</font>		</ol>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Additional Information:</i><br>				Style-linking is used with fonts of all formats in standard Windows applications. Most Windows applications only show the &quot;base font&quot; of any style-linked group in their font menus. The additional style-linked fonts won't show up separately in the font menu of these applications.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Being able to directly pick the style-linked fonts (the bold and italic) is possible in only a few Windows applications, specifically ones that bypass the operating system for their font-handling (including Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign). In typical Windows applications, there is no way other than the style link to access the style-linked fonts. They don't show up in the menu on their own. If you want to get to the fonts that can be accessed by the bold and italic buttons in these applications, the only way to access them is by use of these &quot;stylings&quot;; there is no alternative.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">People who are used to the Mac OS (or applications which allow direct access to style-linked fonts) often incorrectly: (1) expect that you can <i>always</i> &quot;directly pick&quot; even a style-linked bold or italic font from a font menu in any application; and (2) believe there is something wrong or inferior with using fonts via style links.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Using style links does have the limitation that in most applications, if no actual style-linked font exists, the Windows OS will provide a simulated approximation, with no warning that your &quot;base font&quot; is simply being slanted or double-struck to approximate italics or bold. Without close inspection (by zooming in or printing out), it can be difficult to tell the difference on screen. As long as there is a style link, and the linked font is available, the real, style-linked font will be used in the document and in print.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Note:</i><br>This issue applies equally to OpenType, PostScript Type 1 and TrueType fonts on Windows.</font></p>		<h4><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Fonts do not map correctly in documents transferred from Mac OS to Windows:</i></font></h4>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Symptom:</i><br>				When documents are created in some Mac OS applications are opened in the Windows version of the application, incorrect fonts are displayed. Even though the same fonts are installed on Windows, the Windows version of the application doesn't recognize that the same font is installed. The problem occurs in common Windows applications such as Microsoft Word, Adobe PageMaker and QuarkXPress (but not Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign).</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Explanation:</i><br>				This is another aspect of the style linking issue described above. To avoid the problem, whenever possible the Mac OS user must select the base font and use the style links to access style-linked fonts, rather than selecting the style-linked fonts (bold or italic) directly from the font menu.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Background:</i><br>				Most of the information in the style linking section applies for the user on the Mac OS as well, it's just Mac users also have the option of directly selecting the fonts. However, for certain applications, if someone is creating Mac documents that will also be used on Windows, they must use the style links when available, or the Windows version of the application will not be able to correctly identify the font used.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Note:</i><br>				This issue applies equally to OpenType, PostScript Type 1 and TrueType fonts on Windows.</font></p>		<p><a href="#Anchor-Adobe-47296"><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">back to top</font></a></p>		<hr size="5">		<h3><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"><a name="Anchor-MacOSissues"></a></font><font color="#333333" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Mac OS Issues</font></h3>		<p><a href="#Anchor-13991"><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"></font></a></p>		<h4><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Mac OS 8/9 and OpenType fonts not working:</i></font></h4>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">If your OpenType fonts do not work under Mac OS&nbsp;8 or 9, we suggest you check to make sure the following things are true:</font></p>		<ol>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">You are not using an application which is known to not work with OpenType fonts (<a href="#Anchor-22064">see list below</a>).</font>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">You have ATM&nbsp;4.6 or later installed (<a href="#Anchor-58944">see requirements above</a>)</font>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">The ATM control panel is set to &quot;active&quot; (not &quot;inactive&quot;!)</font>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">The OpenType font files are showing up with the correct icon (see &quot;Mac OS&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;fonts losing OpenType icon&quot;&nbsp;below).</font>			<li><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">The fonts are turned on in ATM&nbsp;Deluxe, or they are in the System fonts folder (not a subfolder) if you are using ATM&nbsp;Light.</font>		</ol>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">If the fonts still do not appear in any of your application font menus, try the following steps.

This issue did <b>not</b> affect any Adobe applications using Adobe's common font engine, such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

Non-ASCII characters are those encoded at 128-255 in MacRoman encoding, accessed via option or option-shift key combinations. In applications which are carbonized, and still use QuickDraw for on-screen display (rather than ATSUI or Adobe's common font engine), some of these characters display as different characters or as undefined.

(Unicode is a platform-independent character encoding standard that maps each character in a font to a unique value that is used to access that character.) As a result, the pi and symbol characters in OpenType fonts are not accessible in most applications from normal keyboards.

For these fonts, using the OpenType fraction layout feature can help access these fractions but no others.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Fonts in the second category tend to have thirds and eighths fractions as well as the basic three. For these fonts, one can use the OpenType numerator and denominator features to access the numerators and denominators, and either feature will turn a slash character into a fraction bar.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Later in the development of OpenType, somebody figured out how to do &quot;arbitrary&quot; fractions, creating the third category. Using the same set of glyphs as fonts in category 2, simply turning on the OT &quot;fractions&quot; can make any fraction at all, even things like 1,023.2/14,077.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">When Adobe has had occasion to revise existing &quot;category 2&quot; fonts, we have updated them to &quot;category 3&quot; to support arbitrary fractions. We expect to eventually update all such fonts. Note that newer OpenType fonts such as Garamond Premier Pro, Arno Pro, and Hypatia Sans Pro include additional punctuation glyphs (period, comma, space, left and right parens) in their fraction feature to accommodate languages that use different numerical delimiters. </font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Note that turning on fraction formatting in category 3 fonts can also affect numbers and punctuation that aren't fractions, so one needs to be careful to apply fraction formatting to only the fractions themselves. Even when using fonts where this is not a problem, one might later change fonts, or use a newer version of a font; therefore Adobe strongly recommends that users adhere to this practice even when using fonts for which globally applying fractions formatting does not cause immediate problems.<br>			</font></p>		<p><a href="#Anchor-Adobe-47296"><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">back to top</font></a></p>		<hr size="5">		<h3><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"><a name="Anchor_Polytonic"></a>Polytonic Greek behavior</font></h3>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Some OpenType Pro fonts from Adobe such as Minion Pro, Garamond Premier Pro, Arno Pro, and Hypatia Sans Pro contain a full set of polytonic (ancient) Greek glyphs.

Current compatible drivers are:</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">-Windows 95/98/Me: AdobePS 4.3 and later (version 4.4 is recommended)<br>				-Windows NT: AdobePS 5.1.2 and later (version 5.2 is recommended)<br>				-Mac OS: AdobePS 8.6 and later (version 8.7 or 8.8 is recommended)</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><i>Mac OS 8/9 printing:</i><br>				With foreground printing on, and an external hard drive connected to a PostScript device, some very large OpenType fonts have generated a &quot;TypeCheck&quot; error when printing. Workaround: either use background printing, or disconnect the hard drive from the printer.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><b>PowerPoint 97 (Windows):</b><br>				OpenType CFF fonts can be rotated, while Type 1 fonts cannot.</font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><b>QuarkXPress 4 (Mac OS):</b><br>				Although OpenType CFF fonts generally work with QuarkXPress, trying to use Quark 4's &quot;text to box&quot; function fails, with the error message &quot;cannot turn selected text into a box because the text has no outlines.&quot; <i>This problem is fixed in QuarkXPress 5.</i></font></p>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial"><b>QuarkXPress 6.x (Mac OS X):</b><br>			</font><font size="2" face="verdana">Users of QuarkXPress&reg; 6.x may receive an error message with some OpenType fonts when printing, that the font &quot;may be corrupt and may be substituted with Courier&quot;; simply click OK and proceed.

Zoom levels that are increments of 10 (100%, 110%, 120%, etc.) appear correctly, but other values that are not increments of 10 (162%, 123%, etc.) may display uneven or erratic letterspacing.

If an InDesign document uses only one OpenType CFF font (not one family, but a single font), then Embed Fonts must be set to &quot;Complete&quot; in the Export as EPS dialogue box. If the document uses more than one OpenType font, Embed Fonts must be set to &quot;Subset.&quot; Also, sometimes one must try the &quot;Trap&quot; button twice; the second time works, even though the first time yields a PostScript error.</font></p>		<p><a href="#Anchor-Adobe-47296"><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">back to top</font></a></p>		<p><a href="#Anchor-13991"><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"></font></a></p>		<hr size="5">		<h3><font face="verdana,geneva,arial"><a name="Anchor-57561"></a></font><font color="#333333" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Technical Support</font></h3>		<p><font size="2" face="verdana,geneva,arial">Adobe provides one free technical support call for all type products.
